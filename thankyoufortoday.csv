Digging for gold in my neighborhood,verse,1,Gold Rush
Where all the old buildings stood,verse,1,Gold Rush
And they keep digging it down and down,verse,1,Gold Rush
So that their cars can live underground,verse,1,Gold Rush
The swinging of a wrecking ball,verse,1,Gold Rush

And all our ghosts get swept away,verse,3,Gold Rush
It didn't used to be this way,verse,3,Gold Rush

I've ascribed these monuments,bridge,1,Gold Rush
A false sense of permanence,bridge,1,Gold Rush
